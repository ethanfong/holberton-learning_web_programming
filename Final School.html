<p>Lowell High School is a selective co-educational, public magnet school in San Francisco, California with approximately 2,600 students. The school opened in 1856 as the Union Grammar School and attained its current name in 1896. Lowell moved to its current location in the Merced Manor neighborhood in 1962. It is the oldest public high school west of the Mississippi.

Admission is contingent on submission of an application and based primarily on evaluation of test scores and prior academic record.[4] Lowell High School has been named a California Distinguished School seven times and a National Blue Ribbon School four times.</p>
